I am Kurtwood Greene Sr. After spending two decades (1992 â€“ 2012) as a FoxPro developer, in 2020 I began exploring various modern software development environments.

I am currently improving my skills in the .NET ecosystem. I am particularly interested in Blazor, Web API, EF Core, SQL, and Maui.

I am seeking to collaborate remotely or hybrid within the Tampa Florida area.
